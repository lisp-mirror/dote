1 Introduction
══════════════

  Dawn of the Era (dote for short) will be a fantasy, turn based,
  tactical game.


1.1 Features
────────────

  • procedural generation of:
    • levels;
    • terrains;
    • trees;
    • labyrinths;
    • combat units;
    • game object (potions, weapons, etc..);
    • spells;
    • most of the textures.
  • supported mesh in obj and MD2 file format, tags supported for the
    latter;
  • simple caching system for levels;
  • Opengl GUI (minimal).


2 Current status
════════════════

  The game is not playable but someway interactive, there is an old,
  short video showing the terrain rendering in the video directory.


3 Building
══════════

  A primitive building method using autotools is supported.  For the
  moment just run ./configure and then edit the file src/config.lisp and
  modify the constants \+sys-data-dir\+ \+catalog-dir\+ to match the
  path where the sources are.

  For example

  ┌────
  │ (alexandria:define-constant +sys-data-dir+
  │   "/home/username/lisp/dote/data/" :test #'string=)
  │
  │ (alexandria:define-constant +catalog-dir+
  │ "/home/username/lisp/dote/po" :test #'string=)
  └────

  then open emacs and slime load dote and finally, on the REPL type
  (main-window::main).


3.1 Hardware requisite
──────────────────────

  • 8 Gb of RAM;
  • Accelerated GPU.


3.2 Dependency
──────────────

  Of course a Common lisp compiler is mandatory, the compilation has
  been tested only with SBCL version 1.2.15 on Debian GNU/Linux
  (testing).

  dote depends on the following lisp libraries:
  • uiop (bundled with ASDF3);
  • swank;
  • clunit;
  • alexandria;
  • lparallel;
  • parse-number;
  • ieee-floats;
  • flexi-streams;
  • cl-ppcre-unicode;
  • osicat;
  • babel;
  • trivial-garbage;
  • xmls;
  • cl-i18n;
  • marshal;
  • log4cl;
  • sb-cga;
  • cl-opengl;
  • sdl2kit;
  • s-dot;
  • cl-kanren.

  Please note that s-dot from quicklisp will *not* works, you should
  download the version hosted below
  • [[https://notabug.org/cage/s-dot2]]

  Moreover you will need a Opengl implementation with hardware
  acceleration.  Tested only with Mesa library with Intel(R) HD Graphics
  2500 GPU.

4 Issues
════════

  I strongly recommend you to compile and run the demo in a testing
  environment as it is unstable (i.  e. frequently crash), remember also
  that there is 8.
